More information on OSIS available here: http://www.bibletechnologies.net/


Contributing
===========

Please use the following naming convention (lowercase):

/[language code]/[osisIDWork].xml

Additionally "_whatever" may be appended to the file base name if needed for clarification. For example "kjv_strongs.xml" for Strong's study version. "kjv_nt.xml" for New-Testament-only (if there is not already a osisIDWork for this specific version).

Other Formats
===========

OSIS version split into seperate XML files by book:

https://github.com/lookitscook/osis-bibles/tree/split

(for use with github hosted ajax applications, etc.. so entire text does not need to be loaded up front)

If there is interest in hosting other formats additional branches can be created and the project re-organized accordingly.
